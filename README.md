## Mission I: Nidelva's river plume exploration

###### [Duration: 26th-May - present]
###### [Objective: Get used to autonomous ocean sampling framework]
###### [Outcome: The AUV is able to sample the ocean autonomously]

### Mission log:

#### 26th-May-2021

###### Log:
- LAUV cannot be logged in, which will be solved by Tore today. 
- Boat is not ready, which will be solved tomorrow morning. 
- Naked eyes can barely see the plume.
- Satellite images from yesterday (25th-May) were exploited, not so much can tell (attached below).
- We discussed some future improvements and possibilities about the missions

###### Plan:
- Tomorrow, we do lawn mower manoeuvres as many as we can, as dense as we are allowed to get a better understanding of the plume. 
- 3D simple model will be tested first, and decide whether to continue with complex ones based on what we get.
