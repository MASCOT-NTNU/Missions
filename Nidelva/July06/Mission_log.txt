Mission log

Here is the log for the mission today:

Mission started: 10:00
Mission Ended: 17:30

Mission Objective:
- Set up prior
- Test adaptive algorithm

Mission Details:
- 5 separate scripts were prepared for each layer, in case of boat interventation. 
- However, after the first script, the rest of the scripts cannot be run properly. Therefore, some modifications were made and thus led to some mistakes. The data were not saved correctly. Some of the data were overwritten. 
- The prior was then computed, but after the initial checkup, the coefficients seem not reasonable due to wrong data saving. 
- Therefore, the previous calculated coefficients were used. 
- The adaptive script was tested, but wrong version, thus no pop up was expected. From the eye observation, the AUV went to the place it believed to be the most interesting part. And the mission was aborted due to lack of battery for all the laptops. 

Mission Conclusion:
- The way of setting up prior is too time consuming, and needs to be updated
- The adaptive framework is only tested once, which seems not very sufficient. But future testings are expected in the coming fall.
