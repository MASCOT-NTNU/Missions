# Autonomous Ocean Sampling with LAUV

## TODO before launching the program
- Copy all the files from [REPO](https://github.com/MASCOT-NTNU/Missions/tree/master/Adaptive_script/Porto/Onboard) to the script folder which contains Tore's code

- Next run `Config.sh` to configure the essential paths

- Clean the folder

- Launch the program by `sh run.sh`

- If the mission is aborted due to some reasons such as boat traffic or high waves etc., then one can run `sh run_resume.sh` to continue with the mission without starting from the beginning.
