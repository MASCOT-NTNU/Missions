- Copy all the files from [REPO](https://github.com/MASCOT-NTNU/Missions/tree/master/Adaptive_script/Porto/Onboard) to the script folder which contains Tore's code

- Tore should have set up the right path for IMC-broker.

- Run the IMC-broker before launching the program `sh setup.sh`.

## Mission launching

- Launch the program by `sh run.sh`

- If the mission is aborted due to some reasons such as boat traffic or high waves etc., then one can run `sh run_resume.sh` to continue with the mission without starting from the beginning.
