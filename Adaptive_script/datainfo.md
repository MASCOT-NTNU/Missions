# Data info

- sal is sampled twice every second
- temperature contains so many elements, SmartX is the one which comes from the CTD sensor
- loc is sampled more frequently than sal
- z is not accurate, since it might have some negative numbers
<<<<<<< HEAD
- current data is not complete
- 1 deg in lat is longer than 1 deg in lon
- data slice, use meters
